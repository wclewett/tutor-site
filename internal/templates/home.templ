        <p>Super Hello!!! My name is Fabio, I am a School English teacher in the morning and a Spanish teacher
            certified as an Official DELE Examiner by "Instituto Cervantes" in the afternoon ^.^.
            I also like to describe myself as a history and mythology lover (just for fun ;]),
            and an occasional ship skipper and diver with a geek point.</p>

      @textbox("¬øPor qu√© Yo?") {
        <p>If you want an highly experienced teacher, officially qualified,
            who also loves the entire experience of sharing his knowledge, 
            anecdotes, histories and funny facts with others, I am entirely yours, 
            after my school hours :). Years ago I opened my own Academy but I finally ended up back in teaching at public schools.
            I have a very personal methodology based on students' interest, culture, folklore, fun and music. 
            The experience works perfectly with any language. Since I work at school for educational purposes, I feel like I want to teach in a 
            "different way" my native language. I‚Äôm very passionate with this idea. This is
            the reason I am here; to break my own ‚Äúcountry limits‚Äù. As a result, nowadays my teaching hours are divided between 
            regular school english and teaching my lovely spanish to 
            the entire world through the internet. Not in vain 
            I've been doing this since 2015!!</p>

Not to mention the lessons are always interesting and interactive, the perfect ballance of studying and having fun üôÇ Thank you, Fabio!"</p>

        <p>"I've now had almost 50 classes with Fabio, and it has been and is always a pleasure to learn with him. He's a great conversationalist and is patient with my struggles with grammer or my nuanced questions. I like to talk about a lot of varied topics, and he helps keep the conversation on all of the themes well tailored to my level of understanding. Classes with him feel like hanging out with a good friend, while learning Spanish, and I'd highly recommend him to other students."</p>
